LESS CakePHP plugin

Used to compile LESS CSS code on-the-fly. Combines these two awesome
projects:

- Asset Compress plugin.
  (https://github.com/markstory/asset_compress)

- LessPHP.
  (https://github.com/leafo/lessphp)

How to setup:

1. Install Asset Compress and make sure it is working 100%.
2. Clone (or add as a submodule) this plugin.
3. Make sure you init and update the /vendors/lessphp submodule.
4. Make your APP/config/asset_compress.ini file look like:

    [Css]
    paths[] = WEBROOT/css/
    cachePath = WEBROOT/cache_css/
    filters[] = Less.LessFilter
    filters[] = CssMin

Enjoy.

If you would like to use another version (older/newer) of LessPHP than the one
in the one in the submodule, place it in APP/vendors and the processor will use
that instead.
