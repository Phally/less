LESS CakePHP plugin

Used to compile LESS css code on-the-fly. Combines these two awesome
projects:

- Asset Compress plugin.
  (https://github.com/markstory/asset_compress)

- LessPHP.
  (https://github.com/leafo/lessphp)

It won't parse .less files. Name your files .css or .less.css for example.

How to setup:

1. Install Asset Compress and make sure it is working 100%.
2. Clone (or add as a submodule) this plugin.
3. Make sure you init and update the /vendors/lessphp submodule.
4. Make your APP/config/asset_compress.ini file look like:

    [Css]
    searchPaths[] = WEBROOT/css/
    stripComments = true
    cacheFilePath = WEBROOT/cache_css/
    cacheFiles = true
    filters[] = Less.Less
    filters[] = CssMin

  Less.Less always needs to be the first of the filters!

Enjoy.
